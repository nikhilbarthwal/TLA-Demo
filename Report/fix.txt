Finished computing initial states: 10000 distinct states generated at 2023-10-24 05:17:21.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.2E-10
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.7E-9
134900 states generated, 89950 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 5.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 2 and the 95th percentile is 2).
